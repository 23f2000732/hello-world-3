# Hello, World! — Static Web App

## Overview
This is a minimal static website that greets the user with “Hello”. By default it shows “Hello, World!” and can optionally personalize the greeting via an input box or a URL query parameter.

Built with:
- HTML for structure
- CSS for styling
- Vanilla JavaScript for simple interactivity

Designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Setup
You can run the site locally or deploy it to GitHub Pages.

Local:
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open index.html in any modern web browser.

GitHub Pages:
1. Push index.html and README.md to a new GitHub repository.
2. In your repository, go to Settings → Pages.
3. Under “Build and deployment”, set Source to “Deploy from a branch”.
4. Select the default branch (e.g., main) and the root folder (/), then save.
5. After a moment, your site will be available at https://your-username.github.io/your-repo/.

## Usage
- Visit the site; it will display:
  - An H1 heading with “Hello, World!”
  - A PRE block with “Hello, World!”
- Personalize the greeting:
  - Type your name in the input and click “Say hello”.
  - Or append ?name=YourName to the URL, for example:
    - https://your-username.github.io/your-repo/?name=Alex
